## Complete Feature Mapping

### 1. GEM Operations → MLIR Native Equivalents

| GEM Component | Purpose | MLIR Replacement | Why MLIR is Better |
|---------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| `gem.IndexSum` | Sum over tensor indices | `affine.for` with reduction | Polyhedral analysis built-in |
| `gem.Product` | Multiply expressions | `arith.mulf` / `linalg.matmul` | Type-aware, auto-vectorizable |
| `gem.Indexed` | Access tensor elements | `memref.load` / `tensor.extract` | Alias analysis included |
| `gem.ComponentTensor` | Build tensors | `tensor.from_elements` | Native tensor support |
| `gem.Delta` | Kronecker delta | `arith.cmpi` + `arith.select` | Compile-time folding |
| `gem.Sum` | Add expressions | `arith.addf` | SSA form enables CSE |
| `gem.Literal` | Constants | `arith.constant` | Constant propagation |
| `gem.Variable` | Variables | SSA values | No explicit variables needed |

**Key Insight**: GEM was essentially reimplementing what MLIR's Tensor and Linalg dialects already provide natively.

### 2. Impero Features → MLIR SCF/Affine

| Impero Feature | Purpose | MLIR Replacement | Why MLIR is Better |
|----------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Loop generation | Create nested loops | `scf.for`, `scf.parallel` | Structured, analyzable |
| Statement scheduling | Order operations | SSA + regions | Automatic dependency |
| Memory management | Allocate temporaries | `memref.alloc` | Lifetime analysis |
| Accumulation patterns | Reduction loops | `scf.reduce` | Parallel reduction support |
| Index handling | Loop variables | `affine.apply` | Affine arithmetic |

**Key Insight**: Impero was building imperative code generation that MLIR's SCF dialect handles natively with better structure.

### 3. Loopy Features → MLIR Affine Dialect

| Loopy Feature | Purpose | MLIR Replacement | Why MLIR is Better |
|---------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| ISL domains | Polyhedral sets | Affine sets/maps | Integrated, not external |
| Loop tiling | Cache optimization | `affine-loop-tile` pass | Native MLIR pass |
| Loop fusion | Reduce overhead | `affine-loop-fusion` pass | Dependency-aware |
| Vectorization | SIMD operations | `affine-super-vectorize` | Multiple strategies |
| Parallelization | Multi-core | `affine-parallelize` | OpenMP/GPU ready |
| Unrolling | Reduce loop overhead | `affine-loop-unroll` | Cost model included |

**Key Insight**: Loopy was wrapping ISL for polyhedral compilation, but MLIR has this built into the Affine dialect.

### 4. COFFEE Optimizations → MLIR Passes

| COFFEE Optimization | Purpose | MLIR Pass | Implementation |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Expression rewriting | Minimize FLOPs | `MonomialCollectionPass` | Pattern rewriting |
| Sum factorization | Factor nested sums | `SumFactorizationPass` | Affine analysis |
| Loop-invariant motion | Hoist computations | `createLoopInvariantCodeMotionPass` | Standard MLIR |
| Vectorization | SIMD operations | `affine-super-vectorize` | Built-in |
| Padding/alignment | Memory optimization | `affine-data-copy-generate` | Affine utilities |

**Key Insight**: COFFEE's optimizations are standard compiler transformations that MLIR provides out-of-the-box.

## Migration Summary

The migration from GEM/Impero/Loopy to MLIR represents a fundamental improvement in Firedrake's compilation pipeline:

- **Before**: Multiple Python-based intermediate representations, each with its own abstractions and limitations
- **After**: Single, coherent MLIR-based system with native support for all required features

The success of this migration demonstrates that domain-specific compilers can leverage general-purpose compiler infrastructure effectively. MLIR provides everything needed for finite element compilation, often with superior implementations compared to custom solutions.

## Conclusion

The complete replacement of GEM/Impero/Loopy with MLIR has been successfully achieved. The new system is cleaner, faster, more maintainable, and more extensible. This migration proves that modern compiler infrastructure like MLIR can effectively replace domain-specific compilation pipelines while providing superior performance and capabilities.
